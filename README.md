# Random Quote Generator
This app randomly picks a programming, learning, or success related quote from an array of objects and displays it on the screen.

## Motivation
This is my take on the first project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program from Treehouse.

## Features
* A random quote is displayed upon page load
* The user can see a new quote by pressing the "Show another quote" button
* After 10 seconds the app will automatically display a new quote
* Each time a new quote is displayed the background and button color will also be randomly chosen
