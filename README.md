# Random Quote Generator
This app generates random quotes pulled from an array.

## Motivation
This is my take on the first project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program from Treehouse.

## Build
This project is in the early stages of development and is very much still a work in progress.

## Features
* A random quote is displayed upon page load
* The user can see a new quote by pressing the "Show another quote" button
* After x seconds the app will automatically display a new quote
* As the quote changes so will the background color

## Possible Features
* add the option for the user to tweet out the quote
* add some type of affect to the background make it more interesting
